            There are places that you don’t just visit — you feel them, breathe them, carry them with you. For me, Bandarban is one of those places.

We started our journey from Dhaka at midnight. The highway was quiet, stars overhead, and a sense of adventure bubbled inside me. As the bus climbed the hills of Bandarban in the early morning, mist wrapped around the trees like a soft blanket. I opened the window — cool air hit my face, fresh and wild.

            Next was Amiakhum Waterfall, tucked deep inside the jungle. The trek was challenging — slippery rocks, bamboo bridges, and sudden river crossings. But the moment I saw the waterfall, my tired legs forgot everything. It felt like nature was whispering secrets.

Evenings were magical. In a small tribal village, we shared local food — bamboo chicken and sticky rice. A little boy handed me a flower. We didn’t speak the same language, but we smiled the same smile.
